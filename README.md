Automated Proximity Alert System with App Closure &amp; WhatsApp Notification"

The Smart Proximity Alert & Auto Notification System is an IoT-based security solution that monitors distance using an Arduino-powered ultrasonic sensor. When an object or person comes too close (within a predefined threshold), the system automatically closes the active application and sends an alert message via WhatsApp. This real-time monitoring and response system is ideal for security applications, personal workspaces, and automation setups where proximity-based triggers are required.

The system integrates Arduino, Python automation (PyAutoGUI), and WhatsApp messaging to create a seamless intrusion detection and alert mechanism. This innovative solution ensures that users receive instant notifications while preventing unauthorized access or unwanted proximity.
